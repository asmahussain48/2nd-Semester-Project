<h1>🚀 Mobile Phone Shopping System (Java & MySQL)</h1>

  <p>
    I’m currently working on a hands-on project to develop an <strong>eCommerce platform</strong> for buying mobile phones. 
    Users can easily browse and purchase <strong>new or used phones</strong> with complete details — all from the comfort of their homes, 
    without needing to visit a physical store.

  <h2>💡 Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>🔐 User Login & Role-Based Access (Buyer/Seller)</li>
    <li>🛒 Product Browsing & Buying Flow</li>
    <li>📱 View Full Details of Mobile Phones (Condition, Price, Specs)</li>
    <li>🧾 Shopping Cart & Order Management</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🛠️ Tech Stack</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Java Swing</strong> for GUI development</li>

    <li><strong>JDBC</strong> for database connectivity</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📈 What I'm Learning</h2>
  <p>
    This project is helping me strengthen my skills in:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>🔧 Java GUI development with Swing</li>
